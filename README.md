### Introduction
Restful web app to get information about courses and spaces.<br/>
Please note that this project is completed by me and my partner -- Zehao Zhu.<br/>
I made it public but you should not copy the code.<br/>
### Configuring your environment
To start using this project, you need to get your computer configured so you can build and execute the code. To do this, follow these steps; the specifics of each step (especially the first two) will vary based on which operating system your computer has:<br/>
1. Install git (at least version 2.9; after installing you should be able to execute git --version on the command line).<br/>
2. Install Node LTS (8.X), which will also install NPM (you should be able to execute node --version and npm --version on the command line).<br/>
3. Install Yarn. You should be able to execute yarn --version afterwards.<br/>
4. Clone your repository by running git clone REPO_URL from the command line. You can get the REPO_URL by clicking on the green button on your project repository page on GitHub.<br/>
### Project Commands
Once your environment is configured you need to further prepare the project's tooling and dependencies. In the project folder:<br/>
1. yarn install to download the packages specified in your project's package.json to the node_modules directory. <br/>
2. yarn build to compile your project. You must run this command after making changes to your TypeScript files. <br/>
3. yarn test to run the test suite.<br/>
